## Project Overview
This project analyzes **5 years of Netflix stock prices** (2018â€“2022) to forecast future trends using time-series models. Key steps include:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with decomposition and stationarity checks.
- Implementation and comparison of **10+ forecasting models** (SARIMA, ARIMA, Holt-Winters, etc.).
- Hyperparameter tuning using AIC/BIC criteria.

**Best Model**: SARIMA achieved an **RMSE of 8.86**, outperforming baseline models by **23%**.

---

## Key Features
- âœ… **EDA**: Box plots, seasonal decomposition, and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests.
- âœ… **Stationarity Handling**: Differencing and log transformations.
- âœ… **Model Suite**: AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, and exponential smoothing variants.
- âœ… **Diagnostics**: ACF/PACF plots, residual analysis, and model robustness checks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vn33/Netflix-Stock-Price-Forecasting-2018-2022-.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
---

## Usage
1. Run Jupyter Notebook for EDA and model training:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TimeSeries_analysis.ipynb
   ```
---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Time-Series Decomposition:** Trend, seasonality, and residuals visualized.
- **Stationarity Tests:** ADF test with p-value thresholds.
- **Visualizations:** Box plots for volatility analysis and rolling statistics.

---

## Model Building
- **Baseline Models:** Naive, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing.
- **Advanced Models:** ARIMA (grid-searched parameters), SARIMA (seasonal adjustment).
- **Validation:** RMSE comparison and residual diagnostics.

---

## Key Findings
1. **SARIMA Dominance:** Outperformed all models due to seasonal adjustment (RMSE: 8.86).
2. **ARIMA Overfitting:** Poor performance (RMSE: 13.62) resolved via hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Trend vs. Seasonality:** Netflix stock showed significant seasonal patterns.
